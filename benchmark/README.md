-BuildHull_batch.jl implements the algorithm BuildHull ([Dula, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0400) for computing DEA efficiencyies based on the input-oriented VRS model. It has two parts: BuildHullPhase1.jl and BuildHullPhase2.jl. The packages is used as a benchmark for SearchRef.jl. The detailed results can be found in [A reference-searching–based algorithm for large-scale data envelopment analysis computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10482/).
