# Computational performance comparison
 
 
-**BuildHull_batch.jl** together with the other two files (**BuildHullPhase1.jl** and **BuildHullPhase2.jl**) implement the algorithm BuildHull ([Dula, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1100.0400)) for computing DEA efficiencyies based on the input-oriented VRS model. They are used as a benchmark for SearchRef.jl. The detailed results can be found in [A reference-searching–based algorithm for large-scale data envelopment analysis computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10482/).
